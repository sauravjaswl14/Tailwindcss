Tailwind is utillity-first Framework.Basically it gives you ton of utility classes to work with and create layouts so that you barely have to write any css at all.

Tailwind is a CSS framework that uses low-level "utility" classes to create layouts. Tis is known as a utility-first framework.

Traditional CSS framework like Bootstrap use classes that are directly correlated to components(eg.Alerts, NavBars). Tailwind uses classes as utilities to put together to build your own custom components.

Utility classes are simple HTML classes typically scoped to a single and specific CSS property.
 -> Named according to their purpose
 ->Easy to understand and remember
 -> You know exactly what it does
 -> No naming inconsistenties
 -> Allows for very fast layout creation and testing

//Colors
We have shades from 50 to 900

//Flexbox
Apply a display type of flex to the parent container
-> then those children elements directly within that parent would all become flex items and essentially they become more flexible that means we can control how they shrink and how they grow as well as the spacing between them 

//Flex-Shorthand
 flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;
 flex: 1 0 200px;

//justify-content on main-axis 
justify-content works on main-axis(depending on the flex-flow / flex-direction)


//flex-flow

by default flex-flow is horizontal from left to right and so is the main-axis

when we change the flex-flow to column the main axis is now vertical

//Align-items on cross axis
